## Linear Regression and KNN

For this assignment, we will be working with a data set from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) Machine Learning repository ([see website here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone)). The full data set consists of $4,177$ observations of abalone in Tasmania. (Fun fact: [Tasmania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmania "Tasmania") supplies about $25\%$ of the yearly world abalone harvest.)

![*Fig 1. Inside of an abalone shell.*](images/17612037-abalone-shell-inside.jpg){width="309"}

The age of an abalone is typically determined by cutting the shell open and counting the number of rings with a microscope. The purpose of this data set is to determine whether abalone age (**number of rings + 1.5**) can be accurately predicted using other, easier-to-obtain information about the abalone.

The full abalone data set is located in the `\data` subdirectory. Read it into *R* using `read_csv()`. Take a moment to read through the codebook (`abalone_codebook.txt`) and familiarize yourself with the variable definitions.

Make sure you load the `tidyverse` and `tidymodels`!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
```


### Question 1

Your goal is to predict abalone age, which is calculated as the number of rings plus 1.5. Notice there currently is no `age` variable in the data set. Add `age` to the data set.

Assess and describe the distribution of `age`.

```{r}
abalone <- read.csv("/Users/fangyaner/Desktop/homework-2/data/abalone.csv")
abalone <- abalone %>% 
  mutate(age = rings + 1.5)
```

```{r}
abalone %>% ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram() + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Age of Abalone", x = "Age", y = "Count")
```

```{r}
summary(abalone$age)
```
According to the graph, the distribution of abalone age is a little bit right-skewed. Most of abalones are between roughly 7 and 15 years of age. The most common age is 10 age.\

### Question 2

Split the abalone data into a training set and a testing set. Use stratified sampling. You should decide on appropriate percentages for splitting the data.

*Remember that you'll need to set a seed at the beginning of the document to reproduce your results.*

```{r}
set.seed(1111)
split_abalone <- abalone %>% 
  initial_split(prop = 0.80, strata = age)
train_abalone <- training(split_abalone)
test_abalone <- testing(split_abalone)
head(train_abalone)
head(test_abalone)
```

### Question 3

Using the **training** data, create a recipe predicting the outcome variable, `age`, with all other predictor variables. Note that you **should not** include `rings` to predict `age`. *Explain why you shouldn't use `rings` to predict `age`.*

Steps for your recipe:

1.  dummy code any categorical predictors

2.  create interactions between

    -   `type` and `shucked_weight`,
    -   `longest_shell` and `diameter`,
    -   `shucked_weight` and `shell_weight`

3.  center all predictors, and

4.  scale all predictors.

You'll need to investigate the `tidymodels` documentation to find the appropriate step functions to use.

```{r}
train_abalone_new <- train_abalone %>% select(-(rings))
test_abalone_new <- test_abalone %>% select(-(rings))

recipe <- recipe(age ~. , data = train_abalone_new) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_interact(~ starts_with("type"):shucked_weight) %>%
  step_interact(~ longest_shell:diameter) %>%
  step_interact(~ shucked_weight:shell_weight) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())
recipe
summary(recipe)
```
We shouldn't use rings to predict age because age is original from rings (age = rings +1.5), which is actually a part of age variable. Thus, it is meaningfulness and we shouldn't use rings.\

### Question 4

Create and store a linear regression object using the `"lm"` engine.

```{r}
lm_model <- linear_reg() %>%
  set_engine("lm")
lm_model
```

### Question 5

Create and store a KNN object using the `"kknn"` engine. Specify `k = 7`.

```{r}
knn_model <- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 7) %>%
  set_engine("kknn") %>%
  set_mode("regression")
knn_model
```


### Question 6

Now, for each of these models (linear regression and KNN):

1.  set up an empty workflow,
2.  add the model, and
3.  add the recipe that you created in Question 3.

Note that you should be setting up two separate workflows.

Fit both models to the training set.

```{r}
workflow_lm <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(lm_model) %>%
  add_recipe(recipe)

workflow_knn <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(knn_model) %>%
  add_recipe(recipe)

fit_lm <- fit(workflow_lm, train_abalone_new)
fit_lm %>% 
  extract_fit_parsnip() %>%
  tidy()
fit_knn <- fit(workflow_knn, train_abalone_new)
fit_knn  %>% 
  extract_fit_parsnip()
```

### Question 7

Use your linear regression `fit()` object to predict the age of a hypothetical female abalone with longest_shell = 0.50, diameter = 0.10, height = 0.30, whole_weight = 4, shucked_weight = 1, viscera_weight = 2, and shell_weight = 1.

```{r}
predict_v <- tibble(type = 'F', 
                    longest_shell = 0.50,
                    diameter = 0.10,
                    height = 0.30,
                    whole_weight = 4,
                    shucked_weight = 1,
                    viscera_weight = 2,
                    shell_weight = 1)
predict(fit_lm, predict_v)
```
The age of a hypothetical female abalone is around 21.67.\

### Question 8

Now you want to assess your models' performance. To do this, use the `yardstick` package:

1.  Create a metric set that includes *R^2^*, RMSE (root mean squared error), and MAE (mean absolute error).
2.  Use `augment()` to create a tibble of your model's predicted values from the **testing data** along with the actual observed ages (these are needed to assess your model's performance).
3.  Finally, apply your metric set to the tibble, report the results, and interpret the *R\^2* value.

Repeat these steps once for the linear regression model and for the KNN model.

```{r}
library(yardstick)
metric <- metric_set(rsq, rmse, mae)
lm_tibble <- augment(fit_lm, test_abalone_new)
lm_result <- metric(lm_tibble, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
lm_result
```

```{r}
knn_tibble <- augment(fit_knn, test_abalone_new)
knn_result <- metric(knn_tibble, truth = age, estimate = .pred)
knn_result
```
The $R^2$ value for linear regression model is 0.525. It means that the model explained 52.5% variation in abalone age.\
The $R^2$ value for KNN model is 0.435. It means that the model explained 43.5% variation in abalone age.\

### Question 9

Which model performed better on the testing data? Explain why you think this might be. Are you surprised by any of your results? Why or why not?

According to those two model result, I think linear regression model performed better on the testing data. Compared with these two different models, the $R^2$ value for linear regression model is higher and RMSE and MAE values are lower than the KNN model. Therefore, linear regression model shows more precise prediction. I am surprised with the result the KNN model. Since KNN model tend to be more well-performed and much more general purpose. The reason is maybe in that case the relationship between predictors and age is tend to be more linear.\
